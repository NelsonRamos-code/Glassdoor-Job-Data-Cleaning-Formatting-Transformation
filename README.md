<h1>Glassdoor Job Data: Cleaning, Formatting & Transformation</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved cleaning and transforming real-world Data Science job postings scraped from Glassdoor. The raw dataset contained inconsistent formatting, invalid entries, missing values, and unstructured text fields, making it unreliable for analysis. The goal was to clean, standardize, and engineer features to create a structured, analysis-ready dataset.
